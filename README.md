## Home Automation Simulation using IoT

![Home Automation](link-to-your-image.png)

This repository contains a home automation simulation project implemented using IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how IoT devices and systems can be utilized to create a smart and automated home environment.

### Features

- **Smart Lighting**: Control and automate the lighting system based on occupancy and ambient light levels. Implement schedules or motion detection to optimize energy consumption.

- **Temperature Control**: Monitor and regulate room temperatures using smart thermostats. Adjust the temperature remotely via a mobile app.

- **Security System**: Set up a security system with smart cameras and motion sensors. Receive real-time alerts on your phone when unexpected activities are detected.

- **Appliance Automation**: Automate household appliances such as coffee makers, fans, and air conditioners to respond to specific triggers or schedules.

- **Energy Monitoring**: Track and analyze energy usage in your home to identify areas for optimization and energy-saving opportunities.

- **Mobile Application**: Integrate a mobile application to provide users with remote access and control over the IoT devices and settings.

### Architecture

The project follows a distributed architecture that includes IoT devices, a central server, and a mobile application. The IoT devices communicate with the server over the internet to send data and receive commands. The mobile application acts as a user interface to interact with the smart home system.

### Technologies Used

- IoT Devices: ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Zigbee
- Server: Node.js, MQTT Protocol
- Database: MongoDB
- Mobile App: React Native

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Set up the IoT devices according to the provided documentation.
3. Configure the server and database connections.
4. Build and deploy the mobile application to your device.

### How to Use

1. Connect the IoT devices to your home network and power them on.
2. Open the mobile app and log in to your account.
3. Start controlling and monitoring your smart home devices remotely.
